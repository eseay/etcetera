    /// A developer-provided context to override the underlying default context.
    ///
    /// In most cases there's no need to override this value. You might do so
    /// when your app launches for UI testing, since this scenario cannot be
    /// detected through a generalizable solution:
    ///
    /// For example, in your UI test you might have code like this:
    ///
    ///     let app = XCUIApplication()
    ///     app.launchArguments.append("IS_UI_TESTING")
    ///     app.launch()
    ///
    /// Then in your app delegate, you would forward this to the dependency
    /// container like so:
    ///
    ///     if ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments.contains("IS_UI_TESTING") {
    ///         Container.overrideContext = .userInterfaceTesting
    ///     }
    ///
    /// Lastly, if your application has dependencies that need to be configured
    /// differently for UI tests versus production, you can switch on the
    /// context as needed. Protocols can only be used with `@Global` through an
    /// extension of the `Global` struct that your app provides:
    ///
    ///     extension Global where Wrapped == WebServiceProtocol {
    ///         init() {
    ///             self.init(initializer: { container in
    ///                 switch container.context {
    ///                 case .userInterfaceTesting:
    ///                     return MockService()
    ///                 default:
    ///                     return ProdService()

    ///             })
    ///         }
    ///     }

    /// implementation of a protocol for production versus UI tests:
    ///
    ///     @Global() var webService: WebServiceProtocol

    ///             return Foo(bar: bar)
    ///         }

    /// Or you might use it in a custom extension of `Global`, perhaps to allow
